# weather-or-not

## Description

The Weather Or Not App is a user-friendly and informative weather forecasting application that provides up-to-date weather information for the next five days. This app aims to help users plan their week by offering accurate weather forecasts with an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. I was motivated by a need to practice API calling, on top of building something productive and useful, to build this application.

Looking to plan trip somewhere and need to know what kind of weather you'll be working with? Start here!
